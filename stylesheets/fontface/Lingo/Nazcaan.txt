Thanks for downloading! I created this font in one night from a hi-res scan of the Ni No Kuni manual. Please feel free to distribute and use as you see fit. If you notice any errors, feel free to contact me at mechanicaltigers@gmail.com.

There are no limitations to this font, as I feel it would be better for public use. I would appreciate a nod or a link back if you end up using this font. Enjoy!
