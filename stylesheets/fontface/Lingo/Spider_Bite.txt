Spider Bite Font by MJ

Created 2009, hand-lettered.

This is a free font. Use it however you want, for whatever you want. If you make something cool with it, I'd love to see it - email me and tell me about it. If you offer it for download on your own font site, PLEASE include this Read Me. That's not too much to ask, is it?

This font is intended for specialty and graphic uses. It will look just awful if used in a paragraph format.
